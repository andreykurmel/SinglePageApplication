Cookies are small files or other pieces of data that are downloaded or stored on your computer or other device that can be tied to information about your use of our Sites and Services (including certain third-party services and features offered as part of our Services). Examples of information of this type are your IP address, the browser you are using, the operating system you are using and the pages on the Sites that you visit. </p>
<p>More information on how to modify your browser settings or how to block, manage or filter cookies can be found in your browser’s help file or through such websites as <a>https://www.allaboutcookies.org/verify</a>. Session cookies are deleted when you close your browser session.</p>
<p>You may change your browser setting to decline the use of Cookies (though this may adversely affect your operation or use of the Sites or Services). Before using TablDA websites, you are advised to check your current browser settings to ensure that the settings reflect your consent for TablDA to place cookies on your devices. You do not have to accept our cookies and you may set your browser to restrict their use and you may delete them after they have been placed on your hard drive.

<p><b>Information collected by the TablDA mobile app (iOS and Android):</b> TablDA uses the GPS device on your phone to store its location and display this on a map at <a>https://tablda.com/</a> and your mobile device.

<p><b>How do we use Cookies? </b></p>
<p>We use several different types of Cookies on our website and platform:  </p>
<p><b>Performance Cookies:</b> This type of Cookie helps us to secure and better manage the performance of our Services and remembers your preferences for features found on the Services, so you don’t have to re set them each time you visit. </p>
<p><b>Analytics Cookies:</b> Every time you visit our Services, the analytics tools and services we use generate  Cookies which can tell us (so long as they are allowed and not deleted) whether or not you have visited  our Services in the past, and provide additional information regarding how visitors and users use our  Services (such as how many visitors we have on a certain landing page, how often they visit, or where  users tend to click on our Services). Your browser will tell us if you have these Cookies and, if you don’t but do allow new Cookies to be placed, we will typically generate and place new ones.  </p>
<p><b>Registration Cookies:</b> When you register and sign into our Services, we generate Cookies that let us know whether you are signed in or not and maintain your login session. </p>
<p>Our servers use these Cookies to work out which account on our Services you are signed into and if you are allowed access to a particular area or feature on such account. </p>
<p>While you are signed into our Services, we combine information from your Registration Cookies with Analytics Cookies, which we could use to learn, for example, which pages you have visited. </p>
<p><b>Marketing and Advertising Cookies:</b> These Cookies allow us to know whether or not you’ve seen an ad or a type of ad online, how you interacted with such an ad, and how long it has been since you’ve seen it.  We also use Cookies to help us with targeted advertising. We may use Cookies set by another organization, so we can more accurately target advertisements to you.</p>
<p>We set Cookies on certain other sites that we advertise on. If you receive one of those Cookies, we may use it to identify you as having visited that site and viewing our ad there if you later visit our Services.  We can then target our advertisements based on this information. </p>
<p><b>Third-Party Integration Cookies:</b> On some pages of our Services, other organizations may also set their own Cookies. They do this to enable and improve the performance and interoperability of their applications, features or tools that are integrated with our Services, to track their performance, or to customize their services for you.  </p>
<p><b>How can you turn Cookies off or remove them? </b></p>
<p>All modern web browsers allow you to change your Cookie settings. You can usually find these settings in the ‘Options’ or ‘Preferences’ menu of your browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links to ‘cookies’ help pages may be helpful or you can use the ‘Help’ option in your browser for more details. </p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer </li>
<li>Chrome </li>
<li>Mozilla Firefox </li>
<li>Safari (Desktop) </li>
<li>Safari (Mobile) </li>
<li>Android Browser </li>
<li>Opera </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are primarily concerned about third-party Cookies generated by advertisers, and you live in the USA, Canada or Europe, you can also opt out from the collection of your data by our advertising partners who participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance. Opt-out by visiting: </p>
<ul>
<li><a>http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a> (for U.S. users)

</ul>
<p><b>“Do Not Track” Signals:</b> Some web browsers may transmit “Do Not Track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates, telling the website not to follow its online movements. Because of differences in how web browsers interpret this feature and send those signals, and lack of standardization, it is not always clear whether visitors and users intend for these signals to be transmitted or whether they are even aware of them. Therefore, as many other reputable websites and online platform, we currently do not respond to such “Do Not Track” signals. You may opt out of online behavioral ads at <a>http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p><b>Targeted Advertising Opt-outs:</b> You can also opt out of targeted advertising that we do through our third-party advertising partners, such as Google and Beeswax, by visiting resources they provide (such as <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google’s How Google Uses Information from Sites or Apps that Use Our Services</a>), or by interacting with them through digital advertising self-regulatory initiatives available in the European Union (<a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/">Your Online Choices</a>), United States (<a href="https://youradchoices.com/control">Your Ad Choices</a>), and Canada (<a href="https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools">Your Ad Choices</a>). We may update this list from time to time as similar initiatives become available in other markets. We encourage you to visit all of these sites for additional information about each organization’s approach to targeted advertising, lists of participating companies, and the options available to web users. Please note any third-party opt-outs may require use of a third-party cookie to reflect your choice and clearing third-party cookies from your browser or device may affect or remove your choice.</p>
<h2 style="align-items: center;">V. CHANGES TO OUR COOKIE POLICY</h2>

<p><b>Making Access, Data Portability, Correction, and Deletion Requests:</b> To make an access, data portability, or deletion request, please submit a verifiable Consumer Request by contacting us using the contact information at the end of this Policy. Only you, an authorized agent, or an entity registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable Consumer Request related to your Personal Information.

<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot respond to your Request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. </p>
<p><b>Non-Discrimination:</b> We will not discriminate against you simply for making a Request pursuant to this section of the Policy.</p>
<p><b>GDPR</b></p>

<p>You will be informed if your request will be processed, or you will get an explanation about why it is declined. Once your request is accepted for the deletion, it will take around 5-7 business days to complete. You will receive a confirmation when the deletion is processed.</p>
<p>You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority if you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here:

<p>If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law.
